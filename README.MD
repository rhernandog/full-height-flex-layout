# FlexBox Full Height Dynamic Layout

### Description
A simple layout using flexbox. The main concept is a layout that has a header, a small footer and a content container. The idea is for the layout to use all the available height in the screen when there is little or no content inside the content container, and expand beyond that size when the content size increases.
